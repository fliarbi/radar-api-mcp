# Health endpoint: process liveness

[All endpoints](README.md) · [Account guide](../ACCOUNTS.md)

Checks that this gateway process responds. It does not test Radar, News, identity, billing, database coverage or permission to retrieve a particular company.

## Method and authentication

**`GET /healthz`**

No credential is required; this only reports process liveness. Account operations are HTTP-only and are not MCP retrieval tools.
Management requests share account request-rate limits but do not consume a data
operation credit. The billing callback uses provider-event verification instead.

## Request

This request has no JSON body.

```bash
curl --fail-with-body -X GET "$RADAR_API_URL/healthz"
```

Set the private base URL without a trailing slash. Example IDs identify the
temporary documentation account; use your own returned identifiers when integrating.
Do not paste the redacted credential placeholders into a running application.

## Executed local output

**Provenance: real gateway code and a temporary SQLite account store, with a
synthetic verified Radar identity and synthetic Razorpay provider responses.**
No live user was created, payment collected or production account changed.
The synthetic Business plan and ten-paise credit price exercise the flow;
they do not announce an enabled checkout or an approved pay-per-use tariff.

<!-- response-example: health -->
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "visibility": "private-preview"
}
```

This is the captured **complete response**, HTTP **200**, from
**2026-09-21T04:10:33.455592+00:00**. Retained fields have their original values and types,
except explicitly redacted credentials. Hashes use parsed, sorted JSON after any
credential redaction; they are not hashes of HTTP wire bytes.
The [downloadable JSON example](../examples/health.json) records provenance,
the exact request, omitted paths and a SHA-256 of the original response.
The documentation preserves captured business fields and all array rows. Any
remaining omitted prose is listed explicitly; original counts stay unchanged.

## What this response means

Read ok and version. Treat visibility as a package label; GitHub privacy and proxy exposure must be verified separately.

The capture sequence connected a session, inspected plans, created and listed a
key, linked a placeholder News key, followed one domain, set a spending limit,
created a synthetic order, delivered its signed captured event, inspected usage,
then unfollowed the domain and revoked the key. Responses reflect that order.

Handle `401` by reconnecting an authorized session, `403` by checking plan/access,
and `429` with backoff and the supplied retry interval. Do not automate repeating
checkout requests after an ambiguous network failure: first inspect the provider
order and reconcile its captured status. Key creation reveals a credential once;
key listing is metadata-only. See the [account controls](../ACCOUNTS.md) for
creation caps, shared limits, spending reservations and payment reversal behavior.
